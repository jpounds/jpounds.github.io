# Hi, I'm Jalyn Pounds

I'm a technical writer focused on AI and developer documentation. I specialize in turning complex systems into clear, practical docs that help developers build confidently.

My work emphasizes:
- Clear conceptual explanations
- Step-by-step how-to guides
- Reference-style documentation
- Real-world troubleshooting

## Focus Areas
- AI & LLM developer tools
- LangChain-style documentation
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agents, chains, and prompt workflows

## Writing Samples
> Samples below are purpose-built to mirror modern AI framework documentation.

- **[LangChain Concepts Explained](samples/langchain-concepts.md)** *(conceptual guide)*  
  Explains core LangChain ideas like chains, agents, and tools in plain language.

- **[How to Build a Simple RAG App](samples/how-to-build-rag.md)** *(how-to guide)*  
  Walks through building a basic RAG pipeline with clear architecture explanations.

- **[LangChain Mini API Reference](samples/langchain-api-reference.md)** *(reference guide)*  
  Quick overview of key classes used in a RAG pipeline with code examples.

- **[Troubleshooting Common AI App Issues](samples/troubleshooting.md)** *(support docs)*  
  Covers common failure modes and how to resolve them.

*(Links will be added as samples are published.)*
