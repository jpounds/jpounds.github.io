# Hi, I'm Jalyn Pounds

I'm a technical writer focused on AI and developer documentation. I specialize in turning complex systems into clear, practical docs that help developers build confidently.

My work emphasizes:
- Clear conceptual explanations
- Step-by-step how-to guides
- Reference-style documentation
- Real-world troubleshooting

## Focus Areas
- AI & LLM developer tools
- LangChain-style documentation
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agents, chains, and prompt workflows
