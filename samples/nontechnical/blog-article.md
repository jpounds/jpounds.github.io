# How to Stay Productive Without Burning Out

## Introduction
Productivity isn’t about doing more — it’s about doing what matters efficiently. But many people confuse being busy with being productive. This article will walk through practical tips to stay focused *and* mentally healthy.

## Prioritize What Matters
Start each day by identifying the **top three tasks** that will make the biggest impact. Smaller tasks can wait — don’t let them steal your focus.

## Take Regular Breaks
Your brain isn’t built for non‑stop work. Use techniques like:
- **Pomodoro (25 mins work + 5 mins break)**
- **Walk breaks**
- **Stretching**

Short breaks actually *increase* productivity.

## Eliminate Distractions
Put your phone on silent. Close tabs you don’t need. Simple changes can reduce interruptions and increase deep focus.

## Conclusion
Productivity doesn’t have to come at the cost of your well‑being. By prioritizing, taking breaks, and minimizing distractions, you can work smarter and feel better doing it.
