A cluttered inbox can make finding important messages stressful. This guide shows simple steps you can take to organize your email and keep it that way.

Most email services let you set rules to automatically sort incoming mail into folders.

## Step 3: Unsubscribe from Junk
Go through newsletters and unsubscribe from ones you don’t read. This reduces clutter.

## Step 4: Archive Old Emails
Move old messages you’ve already read into an *Archive* folder so your inbox stays focused on what’s current.

## Conclusion
Organizing your email doesn’t have to be overwhelming. With just a few intentional steps, you can stay on top of your messages more easily.
